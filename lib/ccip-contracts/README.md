# ccip-contracts

A minimal repo that is a copy of the npm package [@chainlink/contracts-ccip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/contracts-ccip/v/1.2.1).

Everyday at 3AM, the latest version of the package is updated here, this way, you can use the Chainlink CCIP contracts with foundry without having to use npm/yarn. This also makes other third party packages like Brownie and Ape easier to work with.

forge install cyfrin/ccip-contracts@1.4.0 --no-commit
```
