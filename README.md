Project Overview

The **RWA Creator** project demonstrates the deployment of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) using Foundry.  
It includes example contracts for synthetic Tesla tokens (`dTSLA` and `sTSLA`) and a bridged WETH token (`BridgedWETH`).  
The `dTSLA` contract has been successfully deployed and verified on the **Sepolia testnet**.
